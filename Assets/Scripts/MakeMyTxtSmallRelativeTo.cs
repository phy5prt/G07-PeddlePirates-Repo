//this has taken too much time for its importance at this point i need to focus minimal viable product and this is polish, when i need a demo

//it is complex to do but possible but not priority at the moment
//but it would be nice to get what the font is for the pirate instruction and set the
//best fit max to 2 less than that for instruction text, so it can still be smaller if it likes
//but can't be bigger
//maybe acheived it now another way

//an issue with code may be a scaling factor though they may share that scaling factor
//so may be able to get arround it if set like to like

//in inspector max size cannot be less than font size so if want to dodge scaling between the two
//would

		//okay this is funky but by setting it to zero i think i set the max to the font size
		//however on testing txt2bRelSize is often out by 1 to 3 for font im using which makes me think scaling factor
		//from rect transforms
		//could do a while loop that keep going through until the font size reduced a bit arbitarily till it is less
		//sloppy though
