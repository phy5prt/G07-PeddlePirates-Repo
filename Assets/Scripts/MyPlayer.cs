//physics approach im not doing
//what in the game soaks up velocity maybe need make the air thick
//made the wood high friction
//get drag right
//if go back to using force could have constant backwards force increases with positive force and max and min velocity so cant constantly accelerate
//or could just increase resistance so as you reach 200% after 100% you have the force against you so if going 200% 100% any futrther output from you goes against you
//so if you put 100% force in 75% takes forward but 25% actual siphened off to go in opposite direction until the force you put in 50% goes into forward force 50% backwards and you no longer accelerate
//because are not adding to velocity 
//just put the forces on like two tanks tricks
//think the root motion of animator may have had an effect t
		//this doesnt seem to provide momentum - this game is fine without - but would be cool
		//currently would work however the root motion of the animation stops it - have taken it off so playing with speed drag and weight will work now
		//if wanted not to freeze in y still could try and see if animation keeps it at a set y (currently below water will need lower terrain)
		//root motion may affect this
