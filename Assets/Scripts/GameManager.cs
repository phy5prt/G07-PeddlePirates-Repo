//need to strip off arduino and do system threading
//https://www.alanzucconi.com/2016/12/01/asynchronous-serial-communication/

//arduino needs to be itsown object

//need to rewrite arduino code for my purpose to optimise how long willing to wait how often am i will to just use the current number
//if the read takes too long
//can it have its own update where it just changes the static as often as it can but nothing waits for it to do it.


//issue because gamemanager not running all its code before other things do maybe need to set things to awake for game manager rather than start

// I can't run this in start // how do i initialise it // if no instance redPShip like when I had it in thisPlayerPairSettings how can i store it
//so i need it to persist
//but can still make everything static so easy to access as this just means instances all share the value

//this player wants a ship holds the min volt for activation later this maybe a event setup option 


//later when putting more choices in event setup may want to put this in
