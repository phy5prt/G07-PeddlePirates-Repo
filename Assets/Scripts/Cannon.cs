//remember to find out how to acknowledge the ship asset



//current code says if something left i stop shooting if something entered i start if two things enter and one leaves i stop, so if i count entered vs left wouldnt risk this

//if i didnt use tags as they change but instead the floats sorting layer, then i could count every tag in out and shoot based on sorting layer - floating or sunk
//then i could just count what leaves and what enters and while enters - left is greater than 0 i should shoot
//another option is when something dies it tells everything its colliding with to stop firing but im already saying stop firing when something dead leaves trigger

//really i should count in and out portential targets going through the collider, stop shooting when none in there
//and if worried the counter will get confused just reset by doing a count of whats in collider to check its right now and again - though i dont know how to
//could check foreach current transform on all ships to see if they are in it not sure if this would be slow.

//code doesnt work because does not fire in the trajectory of the local position
//maybe use transform.forward to make sure cannon ball fires in right direction
//or just trajectory = transform right or left depending on a bool for left or right cannon

// cannon ball vector minus the cannon vector would result in the direction vector then could just multiply
//or try using transform point
//or use transform left right and just alter it

//if checked ships alive or dead not by tag but by if they are floating then they would stay called ship
//see if it can count number of times entered and left to solve the shooting issue


//code needs to not fire on friendly
//code needs the cannon balls to by parented to spawn position so dont move with ship
//repeated triggering shouldnt mean fast firing
//so all cannon balls just childed transform of the spawn point at top

//got lots cannons maybe should just fire when pass through and then have cool down so only using on trigger enter
//only if moved identically in step would this result in not firing when should and because of boats rocking ot sure this would happen
