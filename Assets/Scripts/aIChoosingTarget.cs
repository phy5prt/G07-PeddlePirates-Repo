//need to restructure the enemy ship so has collisions
//so labeled
//so health on top level

//ai now finds enemies and fires, ive fixed the cannons and some are still shooting funny and health not decromented but may be due to collider.root now they 
//share a parent. they dance a bit could be caused by colliders or nav mesh or targetting, so will need to start with targetting (select on the navigator and it 
//shows you the target), if targetting happening because of find targets code may just need to put bigger delay, priority for most recent target - could also be ai's
// syncing with each other causing reciprical movements as try and get to optimum distance from each other.  - either way worth testing if can find new targets without 
//the invoke repeat and if can make it into a singular script

//check ai still updates target location on its own when fed target rather than gameobject being dropped in its public inspector box


//how do i want ai to behave, chase a while, then attack the closer, attack the one coming to it, attack any in 2x firing range other wise stick to their target for x time
//???

//need put in way to differentiate if human or computer player in archetecture just check for navigator!

	//wont work till health is on the top level
	//wont work till network method spawns human into spawn slot

//will look through the spawnpoints and those with children will ask if it is player or ai and will determine which closest and follow them for a certain time before asking again
//it needs a trigger mechanism too where if it sinks something or what its looking at sinks // it finds new enemy - or let timer do it?
